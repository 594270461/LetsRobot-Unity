Let's Robot 
=======

This is the main public repo for all things Let's Robot. 
The main purpose of this software is to develop an internet controlled video live-streaming robot that we are currently calling, "Tellybot". Tellybot is designed to live-stream video to various services like Twitch, Beam, and Facebook, and execute commands given by the audience watching the stream. For instance in the case of Twitch, Telly is designed to read the chat and move forward incase someone says, "forward". 

This contains several projects that are all related to Telly and involve it's various components. 

The Unity project is used for the robots visual interface for streaming.
The Sketch files are the micro controller bits needed to control the various versions of this robot we have.
There is an older stand-alone version of the robot's software that was designed to login from the Pi, however the current system talks to our own web server, and we plan to open this service up to everyone at a future date.
